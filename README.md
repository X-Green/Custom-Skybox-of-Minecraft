# Custom Skybox

## What

This mod allows you to customize the skybox in the game, in ALL DIMENSIONS.

## How

By attaching a resourcepack containing texture files like:

>\assets\eeasee_custom_skybox\texture\nether_sky\x.png
>\assets\eeasee_custom_skybox\texture\overworld_sky\x.png
>\assets\eeasee_custom_skybox\texture\end_sky\x.png

*While x here means numbers from 1 to 6*

>|2\
>|5634\
>|1

1 is BOTTOM; 2 is TOP; 5, 6, 3, 4 is SIDE1~4; they connect as above.

## Optifine?
As far as I'm concerned, optifine realizes the same function, but when compared, this mod is:

1. much more lightweight
2. more features
2. open-sourced support

However, this mod is still in development, meaning bugs and unrealized features. 

If you want to include it in a modpack, please check the compatibility.
